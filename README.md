Starter template for falco projects. To use it, make sure you have the [falco-cli](https://github.com/falcopackages/falco-cli) installed first, then run:

```shell
falco start-project my_awesome_project
```

> [!Note] 
> An alternative way of generating a ready-to-use django project using falco is to visit this 
> repo template: [Falco Template Repository](https://github.com/falcopackages/falco-template-repository). 
> Creating a codespace based on it won't work; you need to click on the **use template** button or **Generate project** on the README. 

For more details on the tools and packages included and the code structure, check out the [full documentationðŸ“š](https://fujin.oluwatobi.dev/en/latest/).
